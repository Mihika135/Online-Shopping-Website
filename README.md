# Online-Shopping-Website

I have created an online clothing store which has many features.

1. Login and Signup with validation and database connectivity which stores the details of new users
2. A main shop page which displays a variety of clothes
3. A filter button which filters the clothes according their type, like casual, party, kurtas, etc
4. A product details page which displays the details of the specific item (all details are extracted from the database using php)
5. On each product details page, some recommendations are displayed based on the category of the item chosen
6. An add to cart button which displays a message once item is added to cart
7. A shopping cart page which shows all the items added to cart and does not allow to checkout until user has logged in
8. Invoice is generated when user successfully places his/her order ad a print button allows them to print the invoice
